# WE see how we can handle data using Redux , Redux is Not mandotary thing , used Widely onle when you required

When you create small app or medium size application its not neccessary to use Redux

# Redux and React is different library

# What is React 
- A predicatable state container for js apps

# What is a Redux-store


# Why we used Redux ?
 - When you create A large Application , Redux offers a great solution for it , handling data managing your store , there are other library also they also do the same thing like zustand , recoil

 - Redux offers Easy Dubugging , just like we have react dev tool  , same we have redux toolkit with use that makes easier to dubugging

 # There Are two libraries rhat redux team offers?
  1) React-Redux -> is Kind a briadge between react and redux
  2) Redux-toolkit -> is The newer way of writing Redux

  We will be using Redux-toolKit , is the new way to writing and implementing Redux and React-redux which acts as a bridge that fill the gap between react and redux

# There are 3 major concern with redux that redux-toolkit solve
 1) Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
 2) i have to add lot of packages to get Redux to do anything usefull
 3) Redux require to much boilaplate code
